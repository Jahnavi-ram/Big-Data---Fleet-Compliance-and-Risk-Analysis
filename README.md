# Big Data — Fleet Compliance and Risk Analysis

This project focuses on processing and analyzing large-scale commercial truck fleet data (500GB+) to identify high-risk driving behaviors, enhance fleet compliance, and support data-driven risk mitigation.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Big Data Processing**: Hadoop (Impala, Pig)
- **Visualization**: Tableau
- **Languages**: SQL

---

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- Processed **500 GB+** of truck accident data using **Hadoop (Impala, Pig)** to uncover behavior patterns based on geolocation, mileage, and vehicle characteristics.
- Built **interactive Tableau dashboards** to visualize safety violations and high-risk behavior clusters.
- Enabled actionable insights for **fleet compliance monitoring and risk reduction**.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Big Data Project.twbx` – Tableau dashboard packaged workbook  
- `geolocation.csv`, `trucks.csv`, `trucks_mg.csv` – Sample datasets used for simulation and dashboarding

---

## 📊 Sample Use Cases

- Identify high-risk truck models or zones based on location data  
- Analyze average mileage per vehicle type linked to violations  
- Monitor accident density to aid fleet safety compliance
